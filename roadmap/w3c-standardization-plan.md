# W3C Standardization Plan

## Path
1. Align credentials with VC Data Model 2.0 (JWT-VC profile first; optional JSON-LD contexts).
2. Publish contexts/types; adopt Status List 2021; produce test vectors and two implementations.
3. Participate in W3C VC WG as use-case contributors or Invited Expert; publish Community Group Report.
4. Interop testing (plugfests) with wallets/verifiers; document results.
5. Advance to WG item → FPWD → CR → PR → REC (2–4 years typical).

## Prereqs
- VC-compliant envelope (issuer/holder/subject mapping, proof, status).
- Contexts hosted at stable URLs.
- Conformance tests and implementations (≥2 independent).
- IPR: ensure RF licensing; document contributions.

## Costs/Benefits
- Membership fees (or Invited Expert). High interoperability with wallets and status ecosystem; complexity of JSON-LD manageable via JWT-VC profile.

## Near-Term Actions
- Draft VC profile doc; create Status List credential; run interop with `did-jwt-vc` + one wallet.
