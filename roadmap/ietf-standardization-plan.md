# IETF Standardization Plan

## Path
1. Define Beltic credential JWT/JWS profile (media types, required claims, status reference, algorithms).
2. Produce individual Internet-Draft in ART/JOSE area; seek feedback on list.
3. Present at IETF hackathon with two implementations; capture interop results.
4. Pursue WG adoption (existing JOSE? new BoF if needed). Iterate → WG LC → IETF LC → RFC.

## Prereqs
- Signed profile with test vectors; at least two independent implementations.
- Clear security/privacy considerations and threat model.
- IANA considerations for media types and any JOSE header parameters.

## Timeline
- 6–9 months to first I-D and hackathon demo; 2–4 years to RFC depending on WG path.

## Recommendation
- Start drafting after JWS profile + status list implemented; run interop early to align with “running code” expectations.
